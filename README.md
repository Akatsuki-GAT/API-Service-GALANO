3. Pokemon site may be blocked for some companies or orgs that blocks gaming websites.
4. Make sure Apache is running
5. If running live based Github link like this to start: https://akatsuki-gat.github.io/API-Service-GALANO/Email_Contact_Form.html
only fruity or API - 3 won't work if step 1 is skipped.
6. Done
